Use `dune` to build/execute/fmt, or have a look at the `Makefile`:

* `dune build`
* `dune exec aoc-2024`
* `dune fmt`

The `bin` directory contains a small main file, running all days at once.
It requires the `inputs` directory to be populated with the input files for each
day, like `inputs/day01.txt`. See the `main.ml` file for all input files.

For each day one module is present in the `lib` directory, containing a `run`
and an `example` function. `run` expects the input of the problem as a string
and computes the results. To run the provided example, no input is required.
