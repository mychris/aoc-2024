= Advent of Code 2024

OCaml project with AoC 2024 solutions.

Developed with `The OCaml toplevel, version 5.2.1`.

[source,ocaml]
----
Aoc2024.Common.time Aoc2024.Day01.example;;

let input = In_channel.with_open_text "path/to/input.txt" In_channel.input_all
in Aoc2024.Common.time (fun () -> Aoc2024.Day01.run input);;

#show Aoc2024;;
----

Use `dune` to build/execute/fmt, or have a look at the `Makefile`:

* `dune build`
* `dune exec aoc-2024`
* `dune fmt`

The executable can run the examples, or a single day as well:
[source]
----
Usage: aoc-2024 [-day <day>]... [-example]
  -day <day> Run <day>. Can be given multiple times
  -example Run the example instead of the input
  -help  Display this list of options
  --help  Display this list of options
----

The `bin` directory contains a small main file.  It requires the `inputs`
directory to be populated with the input files for each day, like
`inputs/day01.txt`. See the `main.ml` file for all input files.

For each day one module is present in the `lib` directory, containing a `run`
and an `example` function. `run` expects the input of the problem as a string
and computes the results. To run the provided example, no input is required.
